# Ruby Refactorings for Sublime Text

This plugin is a work in progress.  Right now Extract to Local Variable is the only refactoring implemented.  The goal is to implement Extract Method and a few other basic refactoring patterns.

Project-wide renaming of public methods is not a goal.  You're still going to have to Grep, Test, and Pray for that one, sorry :)

This plugin is in the alpha stages of development.  The interface and exported command names are still subject to change.
